<h1>localStorage Demo</h1>
<p>This is a demo page for localStorage</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
    // localStorage is like a hash map (aka. js/json object) in the browswer
    window.localStorage.setItem('k1', 'v1');

    // no window. will also work
    localStorage.setItem('k2', 'v2');

    // double quote for string works
    localStorage.setItem("k3", "v3");

    // key, value can be of int type
    localStorage.setItem(4, 'v4');

    // object merge down't work, guess localStorage is special in js
    // can be verified from console.log and alert
    localStorage = {...localStorage, ...{k5: 'v5'}}

    // after object merge, works as before
    localStorage.setItem('k6', 'v6');

    console.log(localStorage);
